      <h1>About Stack Overflow</h1>
      <p>Launched on September 15, 2008, Stack Overflow has grown to become not only the leading question and answer site for programmers, 
but also among the top 50 to 60 of the world's most visited websites. Founded by programmers and bloggers Joel Spolsky and Jeff Atwood,
Stack Overflow sought from the beginning to build a more larger, more effective community of developers than existing sites had achieved. 
It would be free to join and participate to help bring about the large scale participation needed to answer a full spectrum of questions.
The site would also integrate voting and editing to allow the wisdom of the crowd to identify the best answers and to improve and update 
questions and answers as appropriate.</p>
<p>Stack Overflow CEO Joel Spolsky explained how the now-familiar site works in his 
<a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2008/09/15/stack-overflow-launches/" target="_blank">blog post</a> on the site's launch date 9 
years ago:</p>
<blockquote><p>Every question in Stack Overflow is like the Wikipedia article for some extremely narrow, specific programming question. 
<em>How do I enlarge a fizzbar without overwriting the user’s snibbit?</em> This question should only appear once in the site. Duplicates
should be cleaned up quickly and redirected to the original question.</p>
<p>Some people propose answers. Others vote on those answers. If you see the right answer, vote it up. If an answer is obviously wrong
(or inferior in some way), you vote it down. Very quickly, the best answers bubble to the top. The person who asked the question in the 
first place also has the ability to designate one answer as the “accepted” answer, but this isn’t required. The accepted answer floats
above all the other answers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While keeping the site open to all, its founders recognized the drawbacks of giving everyone the ability to edit questions and
answers from the start. For this reason, the site needed to calculate each user's reputation, and grant greater capabilities to users
who proved themselves by writing questions that others valued or through other constructive actions.</p>
<p>With the enormous popularity of Stack Overflow among developers and its continuing growth, Stack Overflow now maintains a database 
consisting of tables ranging from 1 GB to 90 GB each, as SQL Server expert Brent Ozar
<a href="https://www.brentozar.com/archive/2017/07/love-stack-overflow-database/" target="_blank">notes</a>. By making its database 
largely available to the public, including as a Google BigQuery public dataset, the company enables all manner of research.
Given that Quantcast <a href="https://www.quantcast.com/stackoverflow.com#/demographicsCard" target="_blank">estimates</a> that Stack
Overflow reaches more than 29 million people each month and has seen more than 12 billion visits since its founding, its growing dataset 
is likely to remain a valuable source of insights.</p>
