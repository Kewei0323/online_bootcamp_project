How can one compare the quality of soccer players from different leagues? My answer is Reddit which includes a soccer forum wherein individual soccer goals are posted in real-time. The large community of over 500,000 users vote and discuss based on the quality of the goals providing us a rich data set of public opinion of the soccer quality. In this project, first, I scrape data from soccerway website using Scrapy and SelectorGadget. Specifically, the data includes information about the top 5 scorers this current season in each of the top 5 European leagues. Second, I extract data from Reddit using Python Reddit API praw4. Specifically, I collect information including submission time, submission score, number of comments etc. for every Goal posted in the /r/soccer subreddit for the last 4 months.

For the evaluation, first, I analyze the overall statistics for all the Reddit goals data. This includes distribution of comments, submission score and the correlation between the comments and submission score. Second, I compare the Leagues based on the contribution of their top 5 scorersâ€™  goals to Submission score on a weekly basis for a period of 4 months. Last, I compare the submission score time series for the Top 3 scorers across the 5 leagues and the correlation between their submission scores and comments.
