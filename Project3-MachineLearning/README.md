# Otto Group Product Classification Challenge
2015 Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/otto-group-product-classification-challenge

#### Repositories

- Each team member's folder contains their scripts with individual modeling methods and train/test inputs.

- **otto_team_code** - copies of each team member's final scripts used to train their model(s) on the Otto training set.

- **shared_functions** - contains a function to conduct weighted averages of model prediction outputs (class probabilities) in an attempt to blend models for better test accuracy - ultimately, this blending strategy proved unsuccessful.

- **final_test_csv** - final predictions (on unlabeled ~144k row test set) in csv format which were uploaded to Kaggle for leaderboard scores.

The writeup of the process and the outcomes is posted on [the NYCDSA blog](http://blog.nycdatascience.com/student-works/kaggle-otto-classification/).
