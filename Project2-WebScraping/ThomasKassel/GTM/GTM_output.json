{"body": "It's a time of greatuncertaintyforleadingresidential solar installers. Butthere are positive signs with energy companies serving a different part of the residential sector: PACE.Renew Financial, one of the largest purveyors of property-assessed clean energy (PACE) financing, has been in the business for nine years, since founder and CEO Cisco DeVries pioneered the mechanism at the Berkeley city government. PACE lets homeowners buy higher-end energy efficiency and solar improvements with no money down, by distributing the cost across property tax payments over many years.It's taken some time for the approach to spread. For some customers, perhaps, it's hard to get them excited about property tax assessments. And since these assessments happen locally, PACE financiers spent a lot time on policy formation at the city and state level to make this business viable.That work culminated in a billion-dollar payoff.\"We've done a billion overall and we're going to try to do that again this year,\" said DeVries, referring to the dollar value of the company's financing deals. \"That's what we're on pace to do. I have hundreds of millions of dollars of capacity that I'm already spending.\"After all those years building up the model, it's reached a point where Renew could eclipse nine years of business in 2017 alone. Other leading PACE providers like Renovate America and Ygreneare accelerating, too. Americans spend $150 billion annually on home energy improvements, DeVries said, so there's a massive potential market for the PACE companies to chase.\"Most of this is still an education, engagement and market transformation phase, so there's a long way to go before our growth comes at the expense of somebody else,\" he said.The Renew business model can scale in part because its fixed costs are low. The company spends \"hardly any\" money on customer acquisition, opting instead for a channel-driven approach.InCalifornia, the largest PACE market, Renew has vetted and partnered with 2,500 contractors. They serve as the front line for customer engagement, because they're the ones getting calls when a furnace goes out or a roof starts to leak. The partnership with Renew allows the contractors to pitch higher-efficiency products that might be out of range otherwise -- the PACE model unlocks a long-term financing plan with a low cost of capital.\"It's not just providing the financing, which is critical; it is finding people at the moment when they're going to have to make an energy improvement anyway,\" DeVries said. \"If they've already done it, they're not going to touch their furnace again for 30 years. That improvement is going to sit there and it's going to do a bad job for them, costing them money and wasting energy for 30 years.\"When the timing is right and the needs of the customer match the service PACE provides, everybody gets something. The contractor can make more money and get paid quickly and in full by Renew; the customer gets a nicer home improvement that saves more money in the long term; Renew makes money; and the process facilitates a reduction in carbon emissions.As this financing option grows in popularity, it's not hard to imagine less diligent actors chasing those dollars. Without the proper safeguards, an overly zealous PACE purchase could burden a homeowner's property taxes beyond what they can pay off, leading down a dark financial path.So far, DeVries noted, nobody in the U.S. has gone into foreclosure due to PACE. State Sen. Nancy Skinner has introducedlegislationin Sacramento to impose a minimum standard for consumer protection in PACE, a bill the company supports. It's in the industry's interest to keep that foreclosure count at zero.The success of PACE financiers feeds directly into the success of the solar installers they work with (about 20 percent of Renew's business is solar PV installation). This particularly helps the\"long tail\" installers, those local companies that don't have the same kind of financial clout as their nationwide brethren.For those major installers, there may be lessons here about how to strategically avoid paying lots of money to acquire customers, and instead leverage local partners to find buyers at the moment they're most primed for a big energy purchase.", "theme": "ESCOs & Financing Efficiency", "title": "Renew Financial Expects to Close $1 Billion in PACE Deals in 2017Outpacing the Last Nine Years", "comments": "0", "tags": ["california", "energy efficiency", "energy efficiency financing", "long tail", "pace", "renew financial", "residential solar"]}
{"body": "Guardian:South Australian Blackout Blamed on Thermal and Wind Generator Failures, Plus High DemandA blackout in South Australia that has intensified a political brawl over energy policy was caused by three factors: Demand for power was higher than forecast, wind generation was lower than forecast, and several thermal generators were unable to step into the breach, according to the energy market operator.As the partisan conflict about energy continued in Canberra on Wednesday, the Australian Energy Market Operator issued a report detailing the sequence that led to the blackout in South Australia last week -- the third such outage in recent months.Aemo said load shedding became the only option available when it became clear a gas plant at Pelican Point was not available to respond to the surge in demand as local temperatures in South Aaustralia soared last week.Windpower Monthly:How Did Wind Energy Perform Globally in 2016?The Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) has released its annual market statistics for 2016, when total global installed wind capacity reached nearly 487 GW.Led by China, the U.S., Germany and India -- with surprisingly strong showings from France, Turkey and the Netherlands -- the global market was nonetheless less than 2015s record total, says GWEC.Wind power continues to grow in double digits, but we cant expect the industry to set a new record every single year, comments Steve Sawyer, GWEC secretary general. Chinese installations were an impressive 23,328 MW, although this was less than 2015s spectacular 30 GW, which was driven by impending feed-in tariff reductions.Vox:Trump Signs His First Significant Bill -- Killing a Transparency Rule for Oil CompaniesPresident Donald Trump signed his first significant piece of legislation on Tuesday, repealing an Obama-era rule that forced energy and mining companies to disclose any payments they made abroad.This is a big signing, Trump said, a very important signing.That parts...debatable. Outside of a few firms like ExxonMobil -- which once lobbied against the rule and whose former CEO Rex Tillerson is now Trumps secretary of state -- its hard to find too many people overjoyed that this regulation is dead. The real significance here is that this marks the start of a big push by the Trump administration to roll back a wider array of federal regulations.Los Angeles Times:Why Read a 5-Year-Old Book About ExxonMobil Now?If you want a deeper understanding of what has been inaugurated in Washington, read Steve CollsPrivate Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power.Rarely has a book been so profoundly and presciently relevant to events that would take place five years after its publication.It is not just a book about a company -- incoming Secretary of State Rex Tillersons gargantuan, profit-spawning alma mater. It is the portrait of an ethos. And as the pattern of Cabinet appointees makes plain, this ethos has just been ushered out from behind any vestige of discretion to rule unabashed over the executive branch of our government.Gizmodo:Elon Musk to 'Investigate' Tesla's Fremont PlantLast Thursday, Teslas plant in Fremont,California-- where all the companys cars are manufactured -- was thrown a curveball. Jose Moran, a worker trying to rally the plants 6,000+ employees to join the United Auto Workers union (UAW), alleged long hours, low pay, and potentially unsafe equipment in a post.

{"body": "Hawaii will move ahead with a first-of-its-kind community renewables program designed to incentivize dispatchable power at times of peak grid demand.The island state leads the nation in rooftop solar per capita, but many who live there cannot participate in that market. To serve renters, multifamily-housing dwellers, and residents who dont have a high enough credit score or enough available sun to install their own solar modules, the legislature passed a law mandating that utilities create community renewables programs. The utilities then had to figure out how to add these projects to a grid that already faces saturation by solar over-generation in the middle of the day, with nowhere to export to.After somefits and starts, the Public Utilities Commission amalgamated the stakeholder viewpoints and filed an orderFriday to create shared solar projects that will be compensated differently based on the time of day that they provide power. (To access, search for docket 2015-0389 at theHawaii PUCwebsite.)Subscribers to the Community-Based Renewable Energy (CBRE) program will earn 20 percent more for power shipped to the grid during the 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. peak hours compared to midday, defined as 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The off-peak hours from 10 p.m. to 9 a.m. will earn 10 percent more than midday hours. Plants that commit to almost exclusively providing power during peak hours will earn an even higher rate of compensation.Savvy observers of the sun may notice that it has long since vanished from Hawaii when 10 p.m. rolls around. This pricing isnt a scheme to trick community solar participants, but an effort to reward dispatchability, which will most likely be provided by pairing energy storage with the solar and wind installations.Due to the expense of advanced batteries and the still-emerging use cases for them, the additional cost of adding storage to a solar projectonly pays off in select places. As it happens,Hawaii is one of those places.The state has to import fossil fuels for conventional electricity generation, which means electricity costs are more there than in any other state, and that solar paired with storage can compete at higher price points than it could on the mainland. Additionally, the proliferation of solar assets on the islands has led to over-generation at midday, meaning new solar projects risk losing revenue to curtailment if they cant store their energy for use later in the day.All of which cues Hawaii up for a tantalizing experiment in the distribution of electricity: Can a brand-new community solar program do more than its predecessors in other states? Can it create a market-driven, dispatchable resource that helps the entire grid run more efficiently?The PUC states in the order that its goal for the shared renewables program is to create a market-based structure that enables greater customer choice, particularly for those currently unable to participate in onsite distributed generation. The trick is to do that in a way that adds value to the overall grid rather than imposing costs.Typically, shared solar projects offer subscriptions with a flat rate of electricity bill credit for each kilowatt-hour produced.In jurisdictions with lower amounts of renewable energy, minimal [distributed energy resource] penetration and, consequently, fewer immediate DER integration concerns, this arrangement may be ideal for the conditions, the order notes.Given Hawaiis unique grid dynamics, though, the PUC determined that this approach probably wouldnt work. Hawaiis shared renewable program needs to deploy not just clean energy, but clean energy when the grid demands it.Hence the idea to send different price signals based on time of day, originally proposed by the Kauai Island Utility Cooperative and adopted into the docket.Facilities created under this program will earn more money if they can provide renewable energy when the grid needs more energy, and less money for producing when theres a surplus of midday solar. Time of day serves as a proxy for demand, but it's a pretty strong proxy that's been adopted by utilities around the country in the form of time-of-use rate structures.Hawaii's framework also breaks down the project options into three categories: Standard projects, Peaker projects and Utility projects.Standard projects will be developed, owned and operated by a third party. Peaker projects must deliver 85 percent of monthly output during peak hours, and for their service can earn a higher per-kilowatt-hour Peaker Credit Rate during peak hours. This rate is determined during the competitive bidding process and is capped at $0.10 per kilowatt-hour above the on-peak rate. Utility facilities have to provide 75 percent of their capacity to low- or moderate-income customers.The program will phase in over time, with the first phase lasting two years. There will be 18 megawatts of standard facilities allowed at the outset, with 62 megawatts across the three different types of projects available in the second year.Phase two will begin after the commission examines the performance of the first phase and makes tweaks as needed.The latest version of the differential rates based on time of day (Source: Hawaii PUC)Its now up to the utilities and other stakeholders to file comments on the PUCs plan by March 1. The PUC intends to finalize the framework it laid out here, but will consider any necessary modifications. That means we could see some adjustments, but the bulk of the program should work as described in the order.Then comes the really intriguing part: seeing how it works in practice.\"This is the first program weve seen offering incremental compensation for power produced during peak times,\" said Jeff Cramer, executive director of the Coalition for Community Solar Access. \"We expect that community solar-plus-storage can be done, but this is one of the first opportunities to prove if that business model can work.\"Hawaii has more favorable market dynamics for solar paired with storage than most other parts of the country; it could serve as the test case to work out the kinks in a more receptive environment before community solar providers tackle the challenge on the mainland. The key question is whether the program design sends a strong enough market signal for developers to give it a try.Including batteries in a renewables project adds considerable upfront cost. If the spread between the peak earnings and the midday earnings -- 20 percent, not counting the peaker bonus -- doesn't cover that additional cost, project developers may forget about it and just add more solar to the island grids. That would be a disappointing outcome for the program.If a few developers give it a go and can offer potential customers much more lucrative bill savings than the solar-only competition, then the market design should stimulate additional storage investment for dispatchable peak power, as new projects fight for consumer attention. That seems to be the favorable outcome the PUC is hoping for.The differential rates probably won't justify investing in a small amount of storage for a Standard CBRE project, said Ravi Manghani, director of storage at GTM Research. On Oahu, for instance, there's a 3-cent difference in the rates for midday and on-peak. The difference diminishes when you factor in round-trip efficiency losses.A project developer focusing on the Standard category could sell 100 kilowatt-hours at midday and make $15, or store that energy to sell at the higher rate after 5 p.m. With a 10 percent efficiency loss typical of lithium-ion systems, the output of the batteries would be 90 kilowatt-hours credited at 18 cents per kilowatt-hour, yielding $16.20. That kind of delta is not enough to justify storage at current prices.\"If you look at the peaker premium credit rate, that gets closer to the 15-cent delta that is typically seen as the floor to even consider storage for time-of-use shifting,\" Manghani said.The most valuable use of storage, it appears, would be a battery system with the right power/energy ratio to store a full day's solar production and discharge it all within the five hours of the peak, earning the premium peaker rate on every kilowatt-hour produced.The calculus could change based on local factors and the details of storage pricing. Timing matters too: the peaker option doesn't open up until the program's second year, so battery prices will have some time to come down before then. And there are reasons a storage vendor might want to participate even if the economics aren't ideal.\"Given how aggressive storage developers have been in recent months, with the Aliso Canyon procurements as a case in point, you could see vendors remain that aggressive and bid on these projects,\" Manghani said. \"There is so much interest in the storage market that you almost always see the RFPsbeing oversubscribed by developers.\"The Hawaiian community solar market could be valuable to storage companies trying to deploy their batteries, but which haven't yet broken through in procurement processes. There's a value to real-world deployments with reputable customers, and companies may choose to take an upfront loss to achieve that.For this market to take off, it's also crucial that customers actually have an interest in the offerings. The PUC lays out guidelines for the online customer interface that note that ease of use and customer education will play key roles in the launch of the program. If consumers find the program too confusing, they may just put their money elsewhere.Those project developers need not drag their customers into the complexities of differentials in peak versus off-peak generation; they should be able to calculate that themselves and communicate total savings to customers. Anyone casually browsing the marketplace should see greater savings from projects that deliver peak power.It's entirely possible that, after some months of run-time, the PUC may need to recalibrate the incentive structure to ensure it achieves the desired policy objectives.\"Youre developing rate structures and rate designs meant to solve myriad policy goals -- thats a complicated endeavor,\" said Cramer, director of the Coalition for Community Solar Access. \"If they need some tweaks at some point, thats what happens when youre the first to do something novel.\"If this program achieves its goal, though, it will become a new entrant into the growing array of grid-optimizing renewables policies.The initial wave of renewable portfolio standards and net energy metering policies rewarded any renewables put on any part of the grid. They succeeded in spurring deployment, but did not maximize the usefulness of that deployment.More recently, states have tried out methods designed to simultaneously incentivize clean energy and serve other policy objectives.California's NEM 2.0 tariffrewards surplus rooftop solar, but requires that participants switch to a time-of-use tariff, which better reflects the costs of producing grid power at different times. Arizona regulators are mulling a \"clean peak standard,\" which would require a certain amount of peak hour generation come from clean sources.The community renewables program in Hawaii shares that philosophy of generating market signals not just for clean energy, but for clean energy available when it is most valuable for everybody. Other states eyeing their renewable penetration levels and fretting about the possibility of an emerging duck curve have much to gain from this approach.", "theme": "Markets & Policy", "title": "How Hawaiis New Shared Renewables Program Could Benefit the Electric Grid", "comments": "3", "tags": ["community solar", "duck curve", "energy storage", "hawaii", "heco", "kiuc", "peak capacity", "shared solar", "solar-plus-storage", "wind"]}
{"body": "Engadget:Endless Nuclear Power Can Be Found in the SeasThe ocean is a good source of uranium fuel, but it exists in such small quantities that extracting it hasn't been economically feasible. However, Stanford researchers have developed a new technique that can capture up to three times more, meaning we might soon get a new source of uranium that could help keep CO2 in check.A surprising amount of uranium exists in the ocean in the form of positively charged uranyl ions (no jokes please). The total is estimated at 4.5 billion tons, enough to power current plants for around six millennia. However, there's only around a grain of salt per quart (three parts per billion), and so far, it's been too time-consuming and expensive to extract it in decent quantities.Bloomberg: China Nuclear Push Stalled by Next-Generation ReactorsChinas decision to approve its first new nuclear reactors in two years may need to wait for its success starting up the worlds first next-generation units.Plans to green-light eight reactors this year in the worlds fastest-growing nuclear market, announced last week, could depend on whether its able to complete some of the worlds most advanced facilities, including Westinghouse Electric Co.s AP1000 and Areva SAs EPR. The first such reactors may come on-line as early as the first half, followed by new approvals, according to Karl Liu, an analyst at BOC International Holdings Ltd. in Hong Kong.There are indications that Chinese policymakers want to wait for the AP1000s and EPRs under construction to come on-line and see how they do operationally before approving new projects, said M.V. Ramana, a professor at the University of British Columbia. I am not entirely sure that this plan will actually translate into reality.ABC:Solar Power Battery Storage Would Solve SA's Electricity Problems, Company SaysThe company behind a $100 million solar plant with battery storage says its project could solve South Australia's energy woes as the federal government announces a $445,000 investment into a pumped hydro-station for the state.South Australia's power supply has been scrutinized since the state was plunged into darkness last September, and was forced to \"load shed\" during a recent heatwave.South Australian-based renewable energy company Zen Energy is working to build a $100 million solar power plant with 100 megawatts of battery storage in the region.SF Gate:Trump Administration Deals a Big Setback to CaltrainIn the first big hit to the Bay Area from the Trump administration, newly minted Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao has put the brakes on $647 million for Caltrain to go electric -- and in the process pretty much killed hopes for high-speed rail coming to San Francisco anytime soon.It puts the (electrification) project in serious jeopardy, Caltrain spokesperson Seamus Murphy said Friday. Caltrain carries about 60,000 riders a day between the South Bay and San Francisco, but its diesel-driven trains are both costly to operate and slow. Officials see electrification as a way both to increase ridership and save money on operating costs.Renewable Energy Focus:Siemens to Build EnBW Hohe See as First Offshore Wind Project With Extended ScopeIn 2016 Siemens began with the development of project-specific solutions for the foundations of EnBW Hohe See wind power plant with a preliminary project.

{"body": "Lancaster,Californiahas moved beyond requiring solar panels on the rooftops of new houses. A newly passed city ordinance stipulates that those rooftop arrays meet the energy needs of those homes.The city startedrequiring solar on new homesback in 2014, pioneering a policy that has since been adopted bySebastopol,Santa MonicaandSan Francisco, and which was introduced into theCalifornia State Senatein January. Lancasters Zero Net Energy policy, passed last week, mandates that those rooftop arrays contain 2 watts per square foot of real estate.The idea is that new houses added onto the grid cover their own energy needs for their occupants. Not every house will be able to support that much solar capacity, so builders also have an option to pay an in-lieu fee of $1.40 per square feet of constructed home, or a combination of solar panels and fee. The fee option unlocks a 50 percent discount on the generation component of the homeowners electricity bill for 20 years.\"The Zero Net Energy Home Ordinance expands upon Lancasters residential solar ordinance so that new homes built in Lancaster now will not only be environmentally friendly, but have a zero net impact on our environment, while reducing energy costs for the homeowners,\" said Republican Mayor R. Rex Parris in a statement. \"This is a great stride in Lancasters journey to become a Zero Net City.The city has been workingto achieve zero net energy status, which involves leveraging clean renewables to produce more energy than it consumes, since 2011. The implementation of the latest rule must wait for a feasibility study to wrap up, expected in April. Then Lancaster will seek approval from the California Energy Commission. If everything goes smoothly, the rule will take effect before the close of 2017.There are some notable implications from the rule as written.It represents a bolder formulation of the principle that residential solar should be installed at the point of least resistance. It takes time and effort for a homeowner to navigate the bustling marketplace of solar installers, host the installation and figure out financing to pay for it.Policies like the ones Lancaster created shift those tasks to home developers, who are experts at contracting structural additions to houses. Any cost incurred by the solar can then wrap into the mortgage, where it will appear as a marginal increase, without the need for separate financing. The buyer moves in to a home that already generates electricity.Now those houses will generatemore than they were required to before. Its worth noting, though, that square footage is not a perfect stand-in for energy demand. A house with a hot tub, multiple refrigerators and a Tesla will use more than an equally sized abode that lacks those things.The focus on solar generation as the be-all, end-all of sustainable living could run into some issues down the road, as the role of intermittent generation evolves in California. The major utilities are grappling with how to handle the influx of solar production at midday, and the subsequent ramp-up in demand as the sun drops off.The state's utility regulatorrecently approved a switchfrom pure net energy metering to a system where solar homes get charged for their time of use and could earn less money over time for selling surplus energy back to the grid.In other words, a Net Zero Energy plan could need some fine-tuning before going statewide, where it would have a significant impact on those issues already facing the grid. Residential energy storage systems could play a role by letting the homeowners use their solar generation in the evening.Its a bit early in the evolution of these products to start demanding homeowners add them too. The people who move into NZE homes, though, may choose to add a battery system if it makes sense for optimizing their solar use, or if they want solar-powered backup in case the grid goes down.As a smaller city in a sunny part of the state, Lancaster can nimbly experiment with solar home policies and break a trail for others to follow. California is slated toenforce similar measures statewidein 2020, so consider this an appetizer for a bigger solar course to come.", "theme": "Residential Solar", "title": "Lancaster, Calif.
