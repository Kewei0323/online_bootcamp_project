# Off-site H-1B workers scraper

The project was built mostly for the NYCDS scraping project.

Although the scrapers to scrape the [Labor Certification Registry](https://lcr-pjr.doleta.gov/index.cfm?event=ehLCJRExternal.dspAdvCertSearchResult) (using Scrapy and Selenium), the R code (data processing, including getting coordinates by zipcodes) and the data vis (built with D3) can be reused for other projects, the information scraped and analyzed is not sufficient to reach any meaningful conclusion.
